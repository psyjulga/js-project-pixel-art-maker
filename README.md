# My first Masterschool JavaScript Project: Pixel Art Maker

```
After the game is before the game!
In December 2021 I started the Masterschool Web Development
coding bootcamp. What a crazy journey lying ahead!
The first course provided HTML, CSS and JavaScript
fundamentals again, but way more detailed than I knew before.
So the JS project was a bit tricky, as we had to use nested
loops to make this Pixel Art Maker work!
